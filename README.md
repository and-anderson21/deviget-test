# Deviget test - Anderson Alves de Oliveira 

Repository containing Anderson's test for Deviget Magento frontend developer position.


In this repository there is a module to show my knowledge by extending PageBuilder content types, the idea is to add 
a simple aria-label attribute on button item when there is no URL.

In order to show my knowledge on mixins,  you will find a mixin for swatch-renderer file, with a simples JS just replicating the attribute label on the bottom of the product options wrapper.
